# xmrig-wizard
This wizard will guide newbies to be up and running with cpu and nvidia gpu mining in a minute

    PHP (i'm using php7, but will work with >php54)
    php-cli is need for this to run    
  Requires yad:
      ubuntu: apt install yad 
      
  Run:
    chmod +x Wizard.php
    ./Wizard.php
      
  Includes:
      xmrig-cpu and xmrig-nvidia-cuda8 and cuda9 compiled binaries (they haven't been modified)
      some classes programmed for this purpose, someday myZenity will have its own repository.
      
  Todo:
    I'm currently compiling an ISO / USB image with ubuntu desktop and this wizard so anyone from 0-99years could mine cryptonight coins   
    to be installed using composer or something
